# Usage

## Prerequisites

You need a Redis instance to run the code in this repository. It can either be a Docker image, a local server, or a remote server. Please update the host, port, and password [here](/src/main/resources/application.yml) with the correct credentials.

Run the application using your IDE of choice. You should see the following results in console.
```
[null, null, 0.5238106733071787, 0.6238106733071787]
[0.4238106733071787, 0.4238106733071787, 0.5238106733071787, 0.6238106733071787]
[0.1, 0.101]
```
